                        <p>Hello, <br/>

My name is Liton Deb, and I have been involved in the tourism sector in Bangladesh for the past 20+ years. I believe it’s only a matter of time before you introduce Bangladesh as a must-visit destination.</p>

<p>As a freelancer working with multiple companies, I’m well-known as an exceptional guide both in Bangladesh and on social media platforms such as Thorn Tree and TripAdvisor. I speak fluent English and have an in-depth knowledge of my country and its top attractions. I specialize in creating customized tours and offer guiding services throughout Bangladesh, ranging from 1 to 29 days.</p>

<p>I would be very interested in discussing the possibility of working as a guide for your tours when you decide to add Bangladesh to your list of destinations. With my 20+ years of experience, I am confident that I can be a valuable asset to your trips on the ground here in Bangladesh.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve built an extensive network within the tourism industry, including English-speaking service providers such as guides, drivers, restaurateurs, and hoteliers. I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to collaborate with you and bring the beauty of Bangladesh to your clients.</p>

<p>I truly believe Bangladesh would be a magnificent addition to your travel destinations, and I look forward to the possibility of working together soon.</p>
